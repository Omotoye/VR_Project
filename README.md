## Project Objectives

This project involves the development of a game idea (for a VR experience) that takes inspiration from a TV Series called [Upload](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/). To know more about the game, consult the Game Design Document([GDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-RS-KIupoKA7JbYUpA-20rCKfIrBCCjWa_8nktlvXc/edit))

> This repository is merely used to do version control for the files that are not too large which the group will consistently work on, it doesn't contain things like the assets with the meshes we are using for the project, audio files, and basically, anything that'll explode the size of the repository. To get access to the full version of the project, [click here](https://unigeit-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/s5066348_studenti_unige_it/EnB-jiIiSARBr76yWpTcks4BDYz5ufKvNVGSUhcRoQkccg?e=7FdMy9) for the **Onedrive** folder hosting the project files. Unfortunately, the **Onedrive** folder is only accessible by people with a **unige** account (_University of genoa_). If you don't have a unige account and you want access to the folder, contact any of the project members above through the mail.
