- H..Hh..Hi..
- Hello! Are you from here?
- No! I came from another world. What is this place?
- This is Terrafa island. It is the homeplace of our species.
- Have you seen any bears on this island?
- No! The bears territory is on Debba island. It is around three islands from here. How have you ended up on the beach?
- It is a long story. I came from the human world. My cognition has been transferred into a bear's cognition.
- Wow! Is that even possible?
- Ten years ago, it wasn't possible. But, recently, there has been a huge investment in the research of cognition transfer
  between humans and animals conducted by a company called Upload. Last year, they announced that the first successful 
  cognition transfer operation has been achieved between a man and a dog. Since then, many rich people, 
  including my parents, signed contracts with Upload to transfer their cognition into animals' when they die, 
  in the hope of being eternal..
- This is really interesting. But, if you are currently a bear, that means ....
- I think so. Although, the last thing I remember in the human world is that my parents and I were in the car driving to my friend's
  Carl birthday party. How did this happen!
- It is highly probable that you had a car accident and died because of that. Do you remember anything about that?
- My brain is very confused right now. I wonder where are my parents. Have their cognition been uploaded into bears like mine?
  If yes, why aren't they with me? Or maybe they are still alive in the human world! I am very confused and scared. 
- Don't worry. You can stay here with my family and we will figure it out eventually. It is not safe for you to wander alone on this island. 
  Come! I will take you to our territory!
